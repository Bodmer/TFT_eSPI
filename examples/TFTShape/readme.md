# TFTShape
TFTShape is an extension  to draw shape-based objects on screen. The target of this extension is to abstract low level primitives but with full use of the TFT_eSPI core functions (no setPixel operations). Shapes are graphical objects with the most common 2D functionality such as draw, fill, scale and rotate. Shapes consists of vertices which will be interpteted by the TFTShape class to form points, lines, polygons etc. Vertices can be user defined or they can be generated by various TFTShape  builder functions. To give you an overview, here is a short example to see how to use this extension:
