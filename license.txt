The original starting point for this library was the Adafruit_ILI9341
library in January 2015.

The licence for that library is MIT.

The first evolution of the library that led to TFT_eSPI is recorded here:

Adafruit_ILI9341 ORIGINAL LIBRARY HEADER:

vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvStartvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
  This is our library for the Adafruit  ILI9341 Breakout and Shield
  ----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/1651

  Check out the links above for our tutorials and wiring diagrams
  These displays use SPI to communicate, 4 or 5 pins are required to
  interface (RST is optional)
  Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code,
  please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing
  products from Adafruit!

Selected functions from the Adafruit_GFX library (as it was in 2015) have
been imported into the TFT_eSPI.cpp file and modified to improve
performance, add features and make them compatible with the ESP8266 and
ESP32.

The fonts from the Adafruit_GFX and Button functions were added later.
The fonts can be found with the license.txt file in the "Fonts\GFXFF"
folder.

The Adafruit_GFX functions are covered by the BSD licence.

Due to the evolution of the TFT_eSPI library the original code may no longer
be recognisable, however in most cases the function names can be used as a
reference point since the aim is to retain a level of compatibility with
the popular Adafruit_GFX graphics functions.

The major addition to the original library was the addition of fast
rendering proportional fonts of different sizes as documented here:

https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-TFT-display-and-font-library/

The larger fonts are "Run Length Encoded (RLE)", this was done to
reduce the font memory footprint for AVR processors that have limited
FLASH, with the added benefit of a significant improvement in rendering
speed.

In 2016 the library evolved significantly to support the ESP8266 and then
the ESP32. In 2017 new Touch Screen functions were added and a new Sprite
class called TFT_eSprite to permit "flicker free" screen updates of complex
graphics.

In 2018 anti-aliased fonts were added along with a Processing font conversion
sketch.

Many of the example sketches are original work, that contain code created
for my own projects. For all the original code the FreeBSD licence applies
and is compatible with the GNU GPL.
