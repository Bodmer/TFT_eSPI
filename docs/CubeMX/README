This file describes the use of TFT_eSPI with the STM32CubeMX (short CubeMX)
program. It can also be used in Platformio with the stm32cube framework.
It is tested with both.

CubeMX can generate all pin configuration and initial setup. So TFT_eSPI can
make use of these pinnames and setup.

The use of CubeMX will be described in the next staps. It is assumed the user
is known with the use of CubeMX and how to create a base project and how to
create a stm32cube project with the <project>.ioc file from CubeMX

1:  Create a new project in CubeMX and give it some name. Do the basic clock
    configuration.

2:  Define all pins which shall be used in your project. For now stick to the
    basic naming of the pins (TFT_DC, TFT_RST, TFT_CS, TFT_BL, TFT_D(0-7))
    for the parallel usage. For SPI pins use (TFT_MOSI, TFT_MISO and TFT_SCLK).
    GPIO_INPUT / GPIO_OUTPUT according to the use of the TFT_* port.
    And further more the pins you want to use.

3:  Save and generate the code.

Now we split into two lines, A for the use in CubeIDE and B for the use in
Platformio

4A: Create a subdirectory Libraries in you in step 1 created project. Use the
    main folder, not the 'core' folder.
    Copy the TFT_eSPI and TFT_Arduino library into the directory Libraries.
    - Add a 'Define symbol (-D)' to the project with defines
      CONFIG_TFT_eSPI_STM32CUBE. So -D CONFIG_TFT_eSPI_STM32CUBE.
    - Add 2 'Include Paths' for your C and C++ compiler.
      One path '../Libraries/TFT-eSPI' and one '../Libraries/TFT_Arduino'.
      Also add these path to 'Source Location' in 'Path and Symbols'
      Create filter and remove all subdirectories of TFT_eSPI.
    - Build and run the code.

4B: Create a new project with stm32cube as framework. Copy the <project>.ioc
    to the project main directory.
    Install the TFT_eSPI library as normal. You can also install it under the
    'lib' project subdirectory. Install the TFT_Arduino library under the
    project subdir 'lib'.
    Use the following platformio.ini as template:

    [env:<mcu>]
        platform = ststm32
        board = <mcu>
        framework = stm32cube
        build_flags =
	        -D USE_FULL_LL_DRIVER
	        -D CONFIG_TFT_eSPI_STM32CUBE
	        -I lib/TFT_eSPI (only if installed in lib subdirectory)
	        -I lib/TFT_Arduino

    [platformio]
    include_dir = Inc
    src_dir = Src

    Compile and run.
