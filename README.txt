This is a stand-alone library that contains both graphics functions
and the TFT chip driver library. It supports the ESP8266, ESP32 and
STM32 processors with performance optimised code. Other Arduino IDE
compatible boards are also supported but the library then uses
generic functions which will be slower. The library uses 32 bit
variables extensively so this will affect performance on 8 and 16
bit processors.
