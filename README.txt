This is a stand-alone library that contains both graphics functions
and the TFT chip driver library. It supports the ESP8266, ESP32,
STM32 and RP2040 processors with performance optimised code. Other
Arduino IDE compatible boards are also supported but the library
then uses generic functions which will be slower. The library uses
32 bit variables extensively so this will affect performance on 8
and 16 bit processors.
